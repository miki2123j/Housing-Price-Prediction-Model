Performed EDA, and Data cleaning such as handling missing data, handling Outliers, Feature Engineering on the dataset.
Trained the cleaned dataset into multiple ML algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor 
Analyzed the performance of each ML algorithm using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared) and filtered out most important and least important features using visualization.
